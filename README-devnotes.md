## How does it work?

First Google Dialogflow agent is exported into ZIP file and this file is provided to translation utility.</br>
Translation utility parses the file and deserialises its content into internal structures stored in memory.</br>
In fact structures themselves are stored on stack whereas its content is stored on heap. Each entry on heap has its address (referred from stack) and data/content (e.g. string that needs to be translated!)</br>
Translation utility traverses all structures created in deserialization step and creates table to be translated. This table (hashmap) has original heap address as a key and data/content as a value.</br>
Table (i.e. data column) is translated. Two approaches are used:
*	Google V2 translation API
  *	Each row is translated as separate HTTP transaction
*	Google V3 translation API
  *	Hashmap is converted to CSV file
  *	CSV file is uploaded into Google Cloud Storage Bucket
  *	Batch translation is started
  *	Batch translation status is checked regularly up to the point where result is produced again as CSV file in Google Cloud Storage Bucket
  *	Output Google Cloud Storage Bucket content is downloaded and transformed from CVS file into hashmap again
  *	Agent structure is traversed again (same as when creating original translation table/hashmap). For every address we are doing lookup (by address) into translated hashmap and replacing the value accordingly
  *	Agent is then serialized and packed into ZIP file.
